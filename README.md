I am Burak,

I come from a background of molecular biology bachelor degree and evolutionary biology master degree. I jumped into a totally new world. I want to use problem-solving skill, scientific mindset and knowledge in IT, AI and data analytics field.  I have a long road walk, but I am loving it.

I did a student project with my own data set from my master's thesis. It was is a fun journey with a lot of data wrangling and feature engineering.  

I am going to further improve my models and play around with my data set.
